Our database stores information about customers, appliances, technicians, and appointments that customers make.
Each row of each table has a unique ID to keep track of the customers.
On the registration page, customers insert information into the database by completing forms. At the moment, the
quote (appointment cost) is randomly generated, as well as the technician assigned for the appointment. 

On the lookup page, employees can retrieve information from the database based on what they enter into the fields.
They can search for the first and last name of the customer that applied for the appointment, as well as the
appointment date.

htmlspecialchars is used in the viewAppointments.php file to encode characters, which prevents script attacks.
In both PHP files, error handling is used to log potential errors with the insert and select statements.
